I am PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence, studying Deep Learning and Computer Vision at [AImagelab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it), [UniMoRe](https://www.unimore.it). Advocating for attentive architectures for **Vision & Language** and **Genomics** applications, such as image captioning and gene expression. 

I aim to couple my passion for **learning** and my drive to motivate people around me. I believe AI will push human life and medical fields to new universal missions.

I'm a **TEDx Organizer** in the biomedical valley of [Mirandola](https://www.tedxmirandola.com/) and in the italian design valley of [Forte dei Marmi](https://www.tedxfortedeimarmi.com/) !
