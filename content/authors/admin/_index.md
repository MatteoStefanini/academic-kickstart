I'm a connector aiming at combine different ideas with science and entrepreneurship. 

I got a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, working on Deep Learning and Transformer models at [Unimore](https://www.unimore.it), focusing on **Generative AI**,  **Vision & Language** and **Genomics**. 
I believe AI will push life sciences to new breakthroughs.

I'm the Coordinator Manager of [Biomedical valley](https://www.biomedicalvalley.com) and a **TEDx Organizer** in [Mirandola](https://www.tedxmirandola.com/) and in the most exclusive italian location of [Forte dei Marmi](https://www.tedxfortedeimarmi.com/) !
