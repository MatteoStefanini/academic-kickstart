I didn't want to study when I was younger, and now I'm here trying to motivate young people to do it. This is what drives me the most about life!

In this video you can find what motivated me to study in the first part, the bad moments I've gone through, and how I ended up in the artificial intelligence field in the second part, which I'm still learning today.

We're lucky, we live in the most exciting era of humanity. If everything changes so fast, how can we keep up with this pace? Learning to Learn is what I believe the most, along with curiosity.

Forget the "study" obligation, and choose to be free by "learning" the world around you! Having fun, traveling and experimenting with life.

It's not easy, but there is no one excuse.
